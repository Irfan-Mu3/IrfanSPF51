# Irfan's Science Portfolio

## Welcome

Here lies projects I have undertaken to learn and grow in data science. 
These projects mostly showcase how I would handle solving problems for particular datasets, 
but may include self-written statistical software and plotting algorithms.
I hope to accumulate here a display of foundational techniques in solving regression, classification,
clustering and forecasting problems. Additionally, of data-wrangling, and database-querying, within the
_python_ ecosystem.

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:
1) House Price Dataset (Regression)
2) San Francisco's Incident Report Dataset (Forecasting)
3) Adult Salary Dataset (Classification)
4) Airport dataset (Forecasting)

The projects are currently found in the **regression_analysis**, **time_series_analysis** or
**classification_analysis** folder. 

In each project, there are two types of iPython notebooks: 1) Exploratory data analysis (EDA), 2)
Confirmatory data analysis (CDA), which are both self-explanatory. 
The latter notebook depends on the results of the first. Earlier notebooks 
are translations of the python files found in the project which I had written earlier,
and they can be run if wanted. The names of these python files are suffixed with
eda_jup.py or _cda_jup.py.

My approach to data science is mostly a graphical one. 
Hence, I will generally use plots to study the problem at hand, for example to find 
relationships/trends/seasonality/outliers. 
I prefer an approach not too rigorous (e.g. relying strongly on robust statistical testing for significance) 
nor excessively relying on empirical results (e.g. a blind application of models to a dataset). 
Automation is good, but it is half the solution with the other half being to diagnose learnt models. 
Whilst machine learning is appealing,
I prefer to leave M.L. algorithms and models (shallow or deep) for problems overly complicated, such as pattern 
recognition with images for example - for where I would prefer CNNs. CNNs are considered
grey-box as opposed to black-box however, and so aspects of the model can still be plotted
and studied visually.
