# Irfan's Science Portfolio 51

## Hello there!

Here lies projects I have undertaken to learn and grow in data science. 
These projects mostly showcase how I would handle solving problems for particular datasets, 
but may include self-written statistical software and plotting algorithms.
I hope to accumulate here a display of techniques in solving regression, classification,
clustering and forecasting problems. Additionally, of data-wrangling, and database-querying, within the
_python_ ecosystem.

Here are the projects I have worked on:
1) House Price Dataset (Regression)
2) San Francisco's Incident Report Dataset (Forecasting)

The projects are currently found in the **regression analysis folder**, 
or the **time series analysis folder**. 

In each project, there should be two iPython notebooks: 1) Exploratory data analysis (EDA), 2)
Confirmatory data analysis (CDA), which are both self-explanatory. 
The latter notebook depends on the results of the first. These notebooks 
are translations of the python files found in the project which I had written earlier,
and they can be run if wanted. The names of these python files are suffixed with
eda_jup.py or _cda_jup.py.
Any self-written algorithm/software will also be found in the respective project.

My approach to data science is mostly a graphical one. 
Hence, I will generally use plots to study my problem, for example to find 
relationships/trends/seasonality/outliers. 
I prefer not to near ideas from econometrics - performing robust statistical testing, 
nor do I prefer blind application of models to a dataset (e.g. how machine learning is sometimes practised). 
I do not dislike automation, but I take the approach of wanting to plot as much as possible, 
either to learn from or to diagnose learnt models. Whilst machine learning is appealing,
I prefer to leave M.L. algorithms and models (shallow or deep) for problems overly complicated, such as pattern 
recognition with images for example - for where I would prefer CNNs. CNNs are considered
grey-box as opposed to black-box however, and so aspects of the model can still be plotted
and studied visually.

Note that software was written for where
I found existing (statistical) models not being flexible enough,
or when I find existing tools in a particular
programming language unsatisfactory or too immature.
