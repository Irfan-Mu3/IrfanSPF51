# Irfan's Science Portfolio

## Welcome

Here lies projects I have undertaken to learn and grow in data science. 
These projects mostly showcase how I would handle solving problems for particular datasets, 
but may include self-written statistical software and plotting algorithms.
I hope to accumulate here a display of foundational techniques in solving regression, classification,
clustering and forecasting problems. Additionally, of data-wrangling, and database-querying, within the
_python_ ecosystem.

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:
1) House Price Dataset (Regression)
2) San Francisco's Incident Report Dataset (Forecasting)
3) Adult Salary Dataset (Classification)
4) Airport dataset (Forecasting)

The projects are currently found in the **regression_analysis**, **time_series_analysis** or
**classification_analysis** folder. 

In each project, there are two types of iPython notebooks: 1) Exploratory data analysis (EDA), 2)
Confirmatory data analysis (CDA), which are both self-explanatory. 
The latter notebook depends on the results of the first. Earlier notebooks 
are translations of the python files found in the project which I had written earlier,
and they can be run if wanted. The names of these python files are suffixed with
eda_jup.py or _cda_jup.py.

My approach to data science is mostly a graphical one. 
Hence, I will generally use plots to study the problem at hand, for example to find 
relationships/trends/seasonality/outliers. 
I prefer an approach not too rigorous (e.g. relying strongly on robust statistical testing for significance) 
nor excessively relying on empirical results (e.g. a blind application of models to a dataset). 

My approach to M.L. is to leave it for strictly automated work, or for problems overly complicated such as pattern 
recognition with images - for where I would prefer CNNs. CNNs are considered
grey-box as opposed to black-box however, and so aspects of the model can still be plotted
and studied visually. Automation is good, but for some problems perhaps it is half the solution with the other half being to diagnose learnt models. 
Whilst machine learning is appealing,
